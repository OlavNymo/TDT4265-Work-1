# Story board

## Scene 1: Intro

Narration: "Welcome to our exploration of Large Multimodal Models, or LMMs - the cutting-edge AI systems that can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously."

Visual Elements:

- Title text morphs into view: "Large Multimodal Models"
- Subtitle fades in: "Understanding the Future of AI"
- Animated icons representing different data types (text, images, audio, video) float in circular pattern

## Scene 2: What are Multimodal Models?

Narration: "Imagine an AI system that can see, hear, read, and understand - just like humans do. That's what multimodal models are designed to achieve." Visual Elements: - Create a human brain outline - Animate different colored nodes representing: - Vision (blue) - Text (green) - Audio (red) - Video (purple) - Show connections forming between nodes - Transform into a neural network structure

## Scene 3: Core Architecture

Narration: "Let's look at how these models are built. There are two main approaches: the Encoder-Decoder architecture and the Single-Tower architecture."

Visual Elements:

1. Encoder-Decoder:
   - Animate separate encoders for each modality
   - Show data flow with arrows
   - Demonstrate fusion in decoder
2. Single-Tower:
   - Transform previous diagram into unified structure
   - Show token-based processing
   - Highlight shared attention mechanisms

## Scene 4: Training Process

Narration: "Training these models involves three key stages: pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment."

Visual Elements:

- Create three connected circular nodes
- For each stage, expand to show:
  1. Pre-training:
     - Animate data flowing into model
     - Show self-supervised learning process
  2. Instruction Tuning:
     - Display example prompts and responses
     - Show fine-tuning process
  3. Alignment:
     - Demonstrate human feedback loop
     - Show model behavior adjustment

## Scene 5: Capabilities & Applications

Narration: "LMMs can perform amazing tasks across different types of data. Let's see some real-world applications."

Visual Elements:

- Create a hexagonal grid
- Each hexagon reveals an application:
  1. Medical imaging + clinical text analysis
  2. Educational interactive systems
  3. Robotics control
  4. Content creation
  5. Scientific research
- Animate examples within each hexagon
- Show connecting lines between related applications

## Scene 6: Technical Challenges

Narration: "Despite their power, LMMs face several key challenges that researchers are working to solve."

Visual Elements:

- Create three rotating gears
- Each gear represents a challenge:
  1. Modality Fusion
     - Show conflicting data streams
  2. Computational Efficiency
     - Animate resource usage meters
  3. Data Quality & Bias
     - Display imbalanced dataset visualization

## Scene 7: Future Directions

Narration: "The future of LMMs is incredibly exciting. Let's look at where this technology is headed."

Visual Elements:

- Create a road extending into horizon
- Animate milestones appearing along the road:
  - More efficient architectures
  - Better cross-modal alignment
  - Enhanced reasoning capabilities
  - Reduced computational needs
- Use perspective animation to move along the road

## Scene 8: Conclusion

Narration: "As we've seen, Large Multimodal Models represent a significant step forward in AI's ability to understand and interact with our world in more human-like ways."

Visual Elements:

- Bring back key elements from previous scenes
- Create a final unified visualization
- Show contact/reference information
- Fade to end card
