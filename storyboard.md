# Storyboard: Large Multimodal Models - Overview and Methods

## Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

Narration:
"Welcome to our exploration of Large Multimodal Models, or LMMs. Imagine an AI system that can understand our world in all its richness - through text, images, sound, and video. As we see here, each type of data flows into the system, just like our human senses work together to help us understand our environment. These different types of information, which we call modalities, are represented mathematically as inputs X, where each x represents a different type of data our model can process."
Visual Elements:

Title Animation:

"Large Multimodal Models" appears through a matrix rain effect
Letters form from binary (0s and 1s) into clear text
Subtitle morphs: "Understanding the Future of AI"

Modality Representation:

Create circular arrangement of input types:

Text: Scrolling code/words
Image: Camera aperture icon with sample images
Audio: Waveform visualization
Video: Film strip with moving frames

Connect each type with pulsing neural pathways
Simple equation appears: Input={Text,Image,Audio,Video}Input = \{Text, Image, Audio, Video\}Input={Text,Image,Audio,Video}

## Scene 2: Multimodal Architecture (45 seconds)

Narration:
"The magic of LMMs lies in how they process these different types of information. Think of it like translation - each type of data speaks its own language, and our model needs to translate everything into a common language it can understand. As we see here, text becomes word embeddings, images are broken down into meaningful features, and audio becomes frequency patterns. Notice how all these different forms of data gradually transform into a similar format - this is what we call embedding space, where our model can understand and connect information from all sources together."
Visual Elements:

Neural Processing Pipeline:

Demonstrate with simple example: Image + Text understanding

## Scene 3: Core Architectures (60 seconds)

Narration:
"LMMs can be built in two main ways. The first approach, which we call Encoder-Decoder, is like having specialist translators for each type of data, who then work together to create understanding. Watch how each colored path represents a different type of data being processed by its expert. The second approach, Single-Tower, is more like having one super-translator who can handle all types of data directly. Notice how in this case, everything flows through the same pathway but gets processed together. Each approach has its advantages - specialists can be very precise, while the generalist approach can find unexpected connections between different types of information."
Visual Elements:

1. Encoder-Decoder:
   - Animate separate encoders for each modality
   - Show data flow with arrows
   - Demonstrate fusion in decoder
2. Single-Tower:
   - Transform previous diagram into unified structure
   - Show token-based processing
   - Highlight shared attention mechanisms

## Scene 4: Training Process (60 seconds)

Narration:
"How do we teach these models to understand multiple types of information? It happens in three key stages. First, in pre-training, the model learns the basics - like a child exploring the world. Watch how our model learns to connect related concepts: when it sees an image of a dog, it learns to connect it with the word 'dog' and the sound of barking. This foundational learning is represented by our loss function, which measures how well the model is learning these connections.
Next comes instruction tuning, where we teach the model to follow specific directions. It's like moving from basic understanding to performing specific tasks. See how the model learns to answer questions about images, or describe what it sees. Our visualization shows how the model's responses become more accurate with each training iteration.
Finally, in the alignment phase, we ensure the model's outputs are helpful and safe. This is like teaching good judgment. Notice how human feedback helps refine the model's responses, making them more reliable and useful."

Narration:
"These powerful models can solve real-world problems in amazing ways. In healthcare, see how the model can look at both medical images and patient history together - just like a doctor does. In education, it can understand a student's questions in both text and speech, providing personalized help. For robotics, watch how the model helps robots understand both visual cues and verbal instructions, making them more capable assistants. Each application shows how combining different types of information leads to better understanding and more helpful results."

## Scene 6: Technical Challenges (45 seconds)

Narration:
"Despite their capabilities, these models face interesting challenges. First, imagine trying to combine the taste of an apple with the color red - how do we meaningfully connect such different types of information? This is the challenge of modality fusion. Next, these models need significant computing power - imagine trying to process every frame of a video while reading a book and listening to music, all at once. Finally, the quality of learning depends on having good, balanced training data - just like how a student needs good study materials to learn effectively."

Narration:
"We've seen how Large Multimodal Models represent a fundamental shift in AI's capabilities. By processing multiple types of information together - just like humans do - these systems are becoming more capable partners in solving complex problems. As the technology continues to evolve, it promises to bridge the gap between human and machine understanding, opening new possibilities for collaboration and innovation."
