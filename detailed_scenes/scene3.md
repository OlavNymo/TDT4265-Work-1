Visual Elements & Animation Details:

Encoder-Decoder Architecture:

CopyInitial Setup:

- Create 4 input boxes at bottom of screen (x=-6)
  - Text input: Blue rectangle (2x1)
  - Image input: Red rectangle (2x1)
  - Audio input: Green rectangle (2x1)
  - Video input: Purple rectangle (2x1)
  - Add icons inside each box
  - Label each input with Text class

Encoder Animation:

- Create 4 vertical rectangles (encoders) above inputs (y=1)
  - Match colors with inputs
  - Size: 1.5x2
  - Label each as "Encoder"
- Animate data flow:
  - Create small circles in input colors
  - MoveAlongPath from inputs to respective encoders
  - Use rate_func=linear, run_time=1.5

Fusion Process:

- Create central hexagon at top (y=3)
  - Color: White/Gray
  - Label as "Fusion Decoder"
- Animate connection lines:
  - Draw lines from encoders to hexagon
  - Use Create() animation
  - Add moving dots along lines

Feature Vector Visualization:

- Next to each encoder, show simple vector:
  - Text: [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]
  - Use MathTex for vectors
  - Fade in with Write animation

Single-Tower Architecture Transition:

CopyTransform Animation:

- Create copy of previous setup
- Move original to left side (x=-4)
- Fade in "VS" text center
- Create new structure on right (x=4)

Single Tower Structure:

- Create tall rectangle (4x6)
  - Gradient color effect
  - Label as "Unified Transformer"
- Add internal layers:
  - Create 4 horizontal lines
  - Label as "Shared Layers"

Token Processing:

- Create small squares representing tokens
  - Different colors for different modalities
  - Size: 0.3x0.3
- Animate tokens entering bottom
  - Use list of coordinates for placement
  - Stagger entry with succession animation

Attention Visualization:

- Create dot matrix (4x4)
  - Use circles scale=0.2
  - Show connections between tokens
  - Animate opacity of connections
- Add heatmap-style coloring
  - Use color_gradient
  - Animate color intensity

Comparison Callouts:

- Create text boxes highlighting key differences
  - Use arrows pointing to relevant parts
  - Fade in with Write animation

Performance Comparison:

CopyFinal Visualization:

- Create two small graphs bottom corner
  - Show speed vs accuracy trade-off
  - Use Axes class
  - Plot simple curves

Labels and Annotations:

- Add floating text boxes:
  - "Specialized Processing" -> Encoder-Decoder
  - "Unified Processing" -> Single-Tower
- Use arrow class to point to relevant parts
- FadeIn with stagger timing

Transition Out:

- Prepare for next scene
- Keep main architectures
- Fade out supplementary elements
